# Documentation

## 1. Overview of code


## 2. Documentation of implementation

The script builds off of a metapy search engine (set up similarly to the one we used in MP2). 

## 3. Documentation of usage

In order to get metapy to work, I had to use python 3.5 (similar to the setup for MP2). I ran this code on a mac, and found [this post on campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G0A3AA370/feed/1856) helpful for setting up an environment for python 5.3.7.

To use, simply invoke `python recommender.py`. There aren't any command-line arguments to pass - I've hardcoded some of the things that would have made sense as command line arguments to make running the script as simple as possible.

## 4. Description of contribution of each team member

Not applicable - I was the only person on my team.
